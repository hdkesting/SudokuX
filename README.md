# SudokuX

My first WPF program: a Sudoku game.

It can create boards of different sizes:

* 4x4
* 6x6
* 9x9
* 12x12
* 16x16

There are regular (rectangular) grids, but also:

* regular plus diagonals (implemented for 9x9)
* irregular grids (implemented for 6x6 and 9x9)

The challenges can have various symmetries, like:

* none (mainly for for 4x4 and irregular)
* vertical (mirror) symmetry
* both vertical and horizontal symmetry
* rotational symmetry

There are several levels of difficulty possible, although those are not yet fully implemented.

The UI still needs a lot of work.
